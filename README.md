# Automated Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis using Deep Learning
Diabetic retinopathy solution CNN

### Abstract

* Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the common retinal diseases leading to blindness
* In the current clinical diagnosis, the detection mainly relies on the experienced ophthalmologist examining the color fundus image and then evaluates the patientâ€™s condition which is a tedious and time consuming task
* This project is an attempt to provide an automatic diagnosis of DR by performing fundus image classification using CNN

### Dataset Description

The EyePacs dataset was used for image classification. The dataset description is as given below:
